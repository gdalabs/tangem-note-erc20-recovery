# Tangem Note ERC-20 Token Recovery

An open-source Android application to recover ERC-20 tokens accidentally sent to Tangem Note hardware wallets.

## Problem

Tangem Note is an older version of Tangem's hardware wallet that only displays ETH balance in its official app. If you accidentally send ERC-20 tokens (like USDT, USDC, etc.) to a Tangem Note wallet address, the tokens exist on the blockchain but are invisible in the Tangem app, and there's no built-in way to transfer them out.

This app solves that problem by:
1. Reading your Tangem Note card via NFC
2. Displaying any ERC-20 token balance
3. Creating and signing transfer transactions using your card
4. Broadcasting the transaction to recover your tokens

## Features

- **Card Reading**: Scan your Tangem Note card via NFC to get your wallet address
- **Any ERC-20 Token Support**: Select from popular tokens (USDT, USDC, DAI, WETH, LINK, UNI) or enter any custom token contract address
- **Token Info Auto-Detection**: Automatically fetches token name, symbol, and decimals
- **Balance Display**: Shows your ETH and selected token balance
- **Secure Signing**: Transactions are signed on the card itself - your private key never leaves the hardware wallet
- **Transaction Broadcasting**: Sends the signed transaction to the Ethereum network

## Supported Tokens

### Preset Tokens
| Token | Contract Address |
|-------|------------------|
| USDT | 0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7 |
| USDC | 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 |
| DAI | 0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EescdeCB5BE3d823 |
| WETH | 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2 |
| LINK | 0x514910771AF9Ca656af840dff83E8264EcF986CA |
| UNI | 0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984 |

### Custom Tokens
You can enter any ERC-20 token contract address to recover tokens not in the preset list.

## Requirements

- Android device with NFC capability
- Tangem Note card
- Sufficient ETH balance for gas fees (approximately 0.005 ETH)

## How to Use

1. **Install the APK** on your Android device
2. **Enable NFC** in your device settings
3. **Open the app** and tap "Scan Tangem Note Card"
4. **Hold your Tangem Note card** against the back of your phone until the card is read
5. **Select a token** from the preset list or enter a custom contract address
6. **Enter the recipient address** where you want to send the tokens
7. **Enter the amount** to send (or tap MAX for full balance)
8. **Tap "Send Token"** and confirm the transaction
9. **Hold your card steady** while the transaction is signed
10. **Wait for confirmation** - the transaction hash will be displayed

## Technical Details

### Tangem Note Protocol

This app implements the Tangem card protocol directly using Android NFC APIs:

- **AID**: `A000000812010208`
- **READ Command**: Instruction `0xF2` with PIN1 (SHA256 of "000000")
- **SIGN Command**: Instruction `0xF3` with PIN1, PIN2 (SHA256 of "000"), and transaction hash

### Transaction Signing

1. Creates an ERC-20 `transfer` transaction
2. RLP-encodes the transaction for signing
3. Computes Keccak256 hash
4. Sends hash to card for ECDSA signing
5. Recovers the recovery ID (v) from the signature
6. Broadcasts the signed transaction via public RPC endpoints

### Security

- **Private keys never leave the card** - all signing happens on the hardware
- **No external dependencies for signing** - uses Android's built-in NFC
- **Open source** - you can audit the code yourself
